The solution folder contains two projects:

* `Sudoku.Bot`
* `Sudoku.Bot.Console`

Those two projects are used for a social media application called QICQ.

If you want to compile those two projects, please import the NuGet package 'huajitech.mirai.http.0.14.0.nupkg'
in the 'required' folder into those two projects.

If you don't want to compile them, just delete them.
