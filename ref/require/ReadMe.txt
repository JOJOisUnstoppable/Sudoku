The folder 'tessdata' in this folder should be copied to the debug folder
before running the program.
The folder 'tessdata' is used for recognizing a picture where a sudoku puzzle
is in it. 'tessdata' is trainned data for the OCR tool, so this folder is
important.

For example, the debug folder in my machine is
\Sudoku\Sudoku.Windows\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1
